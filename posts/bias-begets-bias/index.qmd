Randomization defeats bias, but we rarely randomize for three reasons:

-   You have to plan ahead

-   It may cost more or result in less data

-   We often don't want to withhold desirable treatments from half of the treatment population

Example: Test effect of a new method of teaching reading on test scores. You really need a randomized control trial. Historical observational studies get confounded by socioeconomic status etc.
