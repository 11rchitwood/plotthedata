title: The Power of Axis Naming

The R language floors me sometimes with how much good stuff has been there form the beginning.

Recently I was listening to [Array Cast Episode 66](https://www.arraycast.com/episodes/episode66-tali-beynon), where the panel and their guest, [Tali Beynon](https://taliesin.ai) discussed the axis naming.
It struck me that R has had axis naming from the get-go, so let me demonstrate.
I'll use Tali's excellent [Classical Array Algebra](https://math.tali.link/classical-array-algebra/) as a guide.

# Basics

## Core Concepts

Here's how to represent four arrays with 0 through 3 axes in R.

```{r}
3 # a scalar
c(4, 0, 3) # a vector
matrix(c(4, 0, 3, 2, 2, 1), nrow = 3) # a matrix
array(c(4, 0, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 0, 1, 2), dim = c(3, 2, 2))
```
