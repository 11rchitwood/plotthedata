title: Rectangling Nested Data

A fun example of how to "rectangle" data about planets and their satellites.

This is another reflection form [Array Cast Episode 66](https://www.arraycast.com/episodes/episode66-tali-beynon) with guest [Tali Beynon](https://taliesin.ai).
Tali mentioned the [Planets dataset in Mathematica](https://tali.link/projects/mathematica/dataset/).
I want to take a sample of this dataset and show how I would work with it in R.

# Data

## Planets

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
planets <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devstronomy/nasa-data-scraper/master/data/csv/planets.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
planets
```

## Satellites

```{r}
satellites <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devstronomy/nasa-data-scraper/master/data/csv/satellites.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
satellites
```
