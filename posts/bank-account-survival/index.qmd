Ever wondered how long your bank account will last?
Your bank wants to know that too.

```{r setup}
library(knitr)
library(survival)
```

Now, let's simulate some data.

```{r data}
# Set a seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Simulate data for bank accounts
n <- 100  # Number of bank accounts
time <- rexp(n, rate = 0.1)  # Generate random survival times (exponential distribution)
status <- rbinom(n, size = 1, prob = 0.7)  # Generate censoring status (0=censored, 1=event)
bank_data <- data.frame(time = time, status = status)

kable(head(bank_data))
```

Then, fit a model.

```{r}
# Fit a Kaplan-Meier estimator
(fit <- survfit(Surv(time, status) ~ 1, data = bank_data))
```

Finally, plot the data.

```{r}
plot(fit)
```
