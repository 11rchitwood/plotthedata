Greetings! My name is Ryan Chitwood. This is [plotthedata](#0), my blog about data science and the like. The name comes from a grad school statistics professor I had whose number one rule was "Always plot the data." Each post culminates in a flagship plot that tries to tell the post's main story.

A bit more about me. I am a Quantitative Analyst at [Synovus](#0). Before that I was the Research & Data Analyst at [PAEA](#0). I have degrees in ecology and wildlife biology from the University of Georgia. While I was there, I studied [black-throated blue warbler](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Black-throated_Blue_Warbler/id) population dynamics. In my spare time, I enjoy playing basketball and hanging out with my family.
